        <h2>The Basic Protein Formula</h2>
        <p>The simplest way to calculate protein intake is:</p>
        <p style="background: var(--primary-bg); padding: 1rem; border-radius: var(--radius-md); font-size: 1.25rem; text-align: center; font-weight: 600;">
          Daily Protein (grams) = Body Weight × Protein Factor
        </p>
        <p>Where the protein factor depends on your activity level and goals, typically ranging from 0.36 to 1.2 grams per pound of body weight.</p>
        <p>For a quick calculation, use our <a href="/">protein intake calculator</a> which does the math automatically.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Step 1: Determine Your Body Weight</h2>
        <p>The first step in calculating protein needs is knowing your body weight. Here's how to get an accurate measurement:</p>

        <h3>How to Weigh Yourself Accurately</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Weigh yourself first thing in the morning</li>
          <li>After using the bathroom</li>
          <li>Before eating or drinking</li>
          <li>Wearing minimal clothing</li>
          <li>Use the same scale each time</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Which Weight to Use</h3>
        <p>You have several options for which weight to use in your calculation:</p>

        <h4>Current Body Weight</h4>
        <p>The simplest approach. Works well for most people at a healthy body fat percentage. Simply use your scale weight.</p>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> People at healthy weight, those maintaining weight, or those slightly overweight.</p>

        <h4>Goal Body Weight</h4>
        <p>If you're significantly overweight, using your current weight can result in unrealistically high protein targets. Using your goal weight makes targets more achievable.</p>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> People with 50+ pounds to lose.</p>

        <h4>Lean Body Mass (LBM)</h4>
        <p>The most accurate method, especially for those with higher body fat. LBM is your weight minus your fat mass.</p>
        <p><strong>Formula:</strong> LBM = Total Weight × (1 - Body Fat Percentage)</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A 200 lb person at 30% body fat has an LBM of 200 × 0.70 = 140 lbs</p>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who know their body fat percentage, bodybuilders, or those seeking maximum accuracy.</p>

        <h3>Converting Between Units</h3>
        <p>If you know your weight in kilograms but want to use pounds (or vice versa):</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Kg to lbs:</strong> Multiply by 2.205 (e.g., 70 kg × 2.205 = 154 lbs)</li>
          <li><strong>Lbs to kg:</strong> Divide by 2.205 (e.g., 150 lbs ÷ 2.205 = 68 kg)</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Step 2: Assess Your Activity Level</h2>
        <p>Your physical activity determines how much protein you need for recovery and adaptation. Be honest about your actual activity, not what you hope to do.</p>

        <h3>Activity Level Categories</h3>

        <h4>Sedentary</h4>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Little to no intentional exercise. Desk job. Maybe walks occasionally.</p>
        <p><strong>Protein factor:</strong> 0.36-0.5g per pound</p>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Office worker who drives to work and doesn't exercise</li>
          <li>Works from home with minimal movement</li>
          <li>Retired person who doesn't exercise regularly</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Lightly Active</h4>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Exercise 1-3 days per week. Light cardio or occasional weight training.</p>
        <p><strong>Protein factor:</strong> 0.5-0.7g per pound</p>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Goes to gym 1-2 times per week</li>
          <li>Plays recreational sports on weekends</li>
          <li>Regular walks or light jogging</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Moderately Active</h4>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Exercise 3-5 days per week. Mix of cardio and strength training.</p>
        <p><strong>Protein factor:</strong> 0.6-0.8g per pound</p>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Goes to gym 3-4 times per week consistently</li>
          <li>Follows a structured workout program</li>
          <li>Active hobbies like hiking, cycling, swimming</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Very Active</h4>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Exercise 5-7 days per week. Intense training or physical job.</p>
        <p><strong>Protein factor:</strong> 0.7-1.0g per pound</p>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Training most days of the week</li>
          <li>Construction worker or other physical labor</li>
          <li>Training for an event (marathon, competition)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Athlete/Elite</h4>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Professional or competitive athlete. Multiple training sessions daily.</p>
        <p><strong>Protein factor:</strong> 0.8-1.2g per pound</p>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Competitive bodybuilder or powerlifter</li>
          <li>Professional or college athlete</li>
          <li>Training twice daily with high intensity</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Step 3: Identify Your Primary Goal</h2>
        <p>Your fitness goal affects your protein multiplier. Different goals require different amounts of protein for optimal results.</p>

        <h3>Maintaining Weight and Health</h3>
        <p><strong>Goal adjustment:</strong> Use the baseline for your activity level</p>
        <p>If you're happy with your body composition and just want to stay healthy, moderate protein is fine. Use the middle of your activity level range.</p>

        <h3>Building Muscle (Bulking)</h3>
        <p><strong>Goal adjustment:</strong> Add 0.1-0.2g to your activity level factor</p>
        <p>Muscle building requires extra amino acids for muscle protein synthesis. However, during a caloric surplus, protein needs are actually relatively lower because adequate energy is available.</p>
        <p>Typical muscle building range: 0.7-1.0g per pound</p>

        <h3>Losing Weight (Cutting)</h3>
        <p><strong>Goal adjustment:</strong> Add 0.2-0.3g to your activity level factor</p>
        <p>During weight loss, protein needs increase to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Preserve muscle mass in a caloric deficit</li>
          <li>Increase satiety</li>
          <li>Maintain metabolic rate</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Typical weight loss range: 0.8-1.2g per pound</p>

        <h3>Body Recomposition</h3>
        <p><strong>Goal adjustment:</strong> Add 0.2g to your activity level factor</p>
        <p>If you're trying to simultaneously build muscle and lose fat, keep protein on the higher end.</p>
        <p>Typical recomposition range: 0.9-1.1g per pound</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Step 4: Choose Your Protein Factor</h2>
        <p>Based on your activity level and goal, select your protein factor from this table:</p>

        <div class="table-responsive">
          <table class="data-table">
            <thead><tr><th>Situation</th><th>Protein Factor (g/lb)</th></tr></thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr><td>Sedentary, maintaining</td><td>0.36-0.5</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Sedentary, losing weight</td><td>0.6-0.8</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Lightly active, maintaining</td><td>0.5-0.7</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Lightly active, losing weight</td><td>0.7-0.9</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Moderately active, maintaining</td><td>0.6-0.8</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Moderately active, building muscle</td><td>0.8-0.9</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Moderately active, losing weight</td><td>0.9-1.0</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Very active, maintaining</td><td>0.7-0.9</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Very active, building muscle</td><td>0.8-1.0</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Very active, losing weight</td><td>1.0-1.2</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Athlete, maintaining</td><td>0.8-1.0</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Athlete, peak performance</td><td>1.0-1.2</td></tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>

        <p>When in doubt, start in the middle of your range and adjust based on results.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Step 5: Calculate Your Daily Protein</h2>
        <p>Now multiply your body weight by your protein factor.</p>

        <h3>Calculation Examples</h3>

        <h4>Example 1: Sedentary Office Worker</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Weight: 160 lbs</li>
          <li>Activity: Sedentary</li>
          <li>Goal: Maintain health</li>
          <li>Protein factor: 0.5g/lb</li>
          <li><strong>Calculation:</strong> 160 × 0.5 = 80g protein per day</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Example 2: Active Person Building Muscle</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Weight: 180 lbs</li>
          <li>Activity: Very active (5x/week training)</li>
          <li>Goal: Build muscle</li>
          <li>Protein factor: 0.9g/lb</li>
          <li><strong>Calculation:</strong> 180 × 0.9 = 162g protein per day</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Example 3: Moderately Active Person Losing Weight</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Weight: 200 lbs</li>
          <li>Activity: Moderately active (4x/week)</li>
          <li>Goal: Lose weight</li>
          <li>Protein factor: 1.0g/lb</li>
          <li><strong>Calculation:</strong> 200 × 1.0 = 200g protein per day</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Example 4: Using Lean Body Mass</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Total weight: 220 lbs</li>
          <li>Body fat: 35%</li>
          <li>LBM: 220 × 0.65 = 143 lbs</li>
          <li>Activity: Moderately active</li>
          <li>Goal: Lose weight</li>
          <li>Protein factor: 1.1g/lb LBM</li>
          <li><strong>Calculation:</strong> 143 × 1.1 = 157g protein per day</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: When using LBM, you can use a slightly higher protein factor (up to 1.2g per lb LBM) since you're basing it on lean tissue only.</p>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Step 6: Calculate Protein Per Meal</h2>
        <p>Once you know your daily total, divide it among your meals for optimal muscle protein synthesis.</p>

        <h3>The Per-Meal Formula</h3>
        <p style="background: var(--primary-bg); padding: 1rem; border-radius: var(--radius-md); font-size: 1.25rem; text-align: center; font-weight: 600;">
          Protein Per Meal = Daily Protein ÷ Number of Meals
        </p>

        <h3>Distribution Examples</h3>
        <div class="table-responsive">
          <table class="data-table">
            <thead><tr><th>Daily Total</th><th>3 Meals</th><th>4 Meals</th><th>5 Meals</th></tr></thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr><td>90g</td><td>30g each</td><td>22-23g each</td><td>18g each</td></tr>
              <tr><td>120g</td><td>40g each</td><td>30g each</td><td>24g each</td></tr>
              <tr><td>150g</td><td>50g each</td><td>37-38g each</td><td>30g each</td></tr>
              <tr><td>180g</td><td>60g each</td><td>45g each</td><td>36g each</td></tr>
              <tr><td>200g</td><td>66-67g each</td><td>50g each</td><td>40g each</td></tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>

        <h3>Why Distribution Matters</h3>
        <p>Research shows that muscle protein synthesis is maximally stimulated by 20-40g of protein per meal. Spreading protein evenly triggers multiple MPS peaks throughout the day, which is better than eating most protein at one meal.</p>
        <p>For most people, 4-5 protein-rich meals work better than 3 large ones or 6+ small ones.</p>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Alternative Calculation Methods</h2>
        <p>While the body weight method is most common, here are other ways to calculate protein needs.</p>

        <h3>Method 2: Percentage of Calories</h3>
        <p>Some people prefer calculating protein as a percentage of total calories.</p>
        <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Daily Protein = (Total Daily Calories × Protein Percentage) ÷ 4</p>
        <p>(Divided by 4 because protein has 4 calories per gram)</p>
        <p>Typical protein percentages:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>General health: 15-20% of calories</li>
          <li>Active/fitness: 25-30% of calories</li>
          <li>Muscle building: 25-35% of calories</li>
          <li>Weight loss: 30-40% of calories</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Someone eating 2,000 calories aiming for 30% protein:<br>
        (2,000 × 0.30) ÷ 4 = 150g protein</p>

        <h3>Method 3: Fixed Amount</h3>
        <p>The simplest but least personalized approach. Common fixed targets:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Minimum (RDA): 46g women, 56g men</li>
          <li>General fitness: 100g</li>
          <li>Active fitness: 150g</li>
          <li>Serious athlete: 200g+</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This method doesn't account for body size, so it's only useful as a rough guideline.</p>

        <h3>Method 4: The 1g Per Pound Rule</h3>
        <p>A popular simplified approach in fitness communities: eat 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight.</p>
        <p>This tends to be on the higher end of what's necessary, but it's simple to remember and provides a margin of safety. It works well for active people with fitness goals.</p>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Adjusting Your Calculation Over Time</h2>
        <p>Your initial calculation is a starting point. Adjust based on results and changing circumstances.</p>

        <h3>When to Recalculate</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Weight change:</strong> Recalculate every 10-15 lbs lost or gained</li>
          <li><strong>Activity change:</strong> If you start exercising more (or less) regularly</li>
          <li><strong>Goal change:</strong> Switching from maintenance to muscle building or weight loss</li>
          <li><strong>Life stage change:</strong> Pregnancy, aging, major health changes</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Signs You Need More Protein</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Losing muscle despite training</li>
          <li>Constantly hungry, even after meals</li>
          <li>Slow recovery from workouts</li>
          <li>Weakness or fatigue</li>
          <li>Poor results despite consistent training</li>

        <h2>Putting It Into Practice</h2>
        <p>Here's a complete example of going from calculation to daily eating plan.</p>

        <h3>Case Study: Sarah, 145 lbs</h3>
        <p><strong>Profile:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Weight: 145 lbs</li>
          <li>Activity: Moderately active (gym 4x/week)</li>
          <li>Goal: Lose 15 lbs while toning</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Calculation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Activity level: Moderately active</li>
          <li>Goal adjustment: Weight loss (+0.2-0.3g)</li>
          <li>Protein factor: 1.0g/lb</li>
          <li>Daily protein: 145 × 1.0 = 145g</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Meal Distribution (4 meals):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Breakfast: 36g</li>
          <li>Lunch: 36g</li>
          <li>Snack: 36g</li>
          <li>Dinner: 37g</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Sample Day:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Breakfast:</strong> 3 eggs + Greek yogurt = 36g</li>
          <li><strong>Lunch:</strong> 5 oz chicken breast + salad = 38g</li>
          <li><strong>Snack:</strong> Protein shake + almonds = 32g</li>
          <li><strong>Dinner:</strong> 5 oz salmon + vegetables + quinoa = 38g</li>
          <li><strong>Total: 144g protein</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Three worked examples</h4>
        <p>A 150 lb sedentary adult: 150 x 0.5 = 75g. A 180 lb gym-goer building muscle: 180 x 0.9 = 162g. A 200 lb person losing weight: 200 x 1.0 = 200g. The formula is simple -- the key is choosing the right multiplier.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div class="faq-list">
          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">Should I calculate based on current weight or goal weight?<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></button>
            <div class="faq-answer"><p>For most people, use current weight. If you're significantly overweight (50+ lbs to lose), using goal weight or lean body mass gives more achievable targets. You can also use LBM if you know your body fat percentage for the most accurate calculation.</p></div>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">Do I need to hit my exact protein target every day?<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></button>
            <div class="faq-answer"><p>No, being within 10-20g of your target is fine. Consistency matters more than perfection. Hitting your target most days is better than hitting it perfectly some days and missing it entirely on others.</p></div>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">How do I calculate protein if I use kilograms?<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></button>
            <div class="faq-answer"><p>Multiply your weight in kg by 2.205 to convert to pounds, then use the formulas above. Or use these kg-based factors: sedentary 0.8-1.1g/kg, active 1.4-1.8g/kg, muscle building 1.6-2.2g/kg, weight loss 1.8-2.6g/kg.</p></div>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">What if my calculated protein seems too high?<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></button>
            <div class="faq-answer"><p>If your target seems unachievable, start at the lower end of your range and gradually increase. You can also recalculate using lean body mass instead of total weight. Remember that the recommended ranges have flexibility; use the amount that fits your lifestyle while still achieving results.</p></div>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">Should protein calculation change as I age?<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></button>
            <div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes. Adults over 50 should aim for higher protein (add 0.1-0.2g to their factor) to combat age-related muscle loss. Older adults often benefit from 0.5-0.9g per pound rather than the lower ranges younger sedentary adults might use.</p></div>

        <h2>Summary: The 5-Step Process</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Determine your body weight (current, goal, or lean body mass)</li>
          <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Assess your activity level honestly</li>
          <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Identify your primary goal (maintain, build, or lose)</li>
          <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Select your protein factor from the table</li>
          <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Multiply: Weight × Factor = Daily Protein</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Then divide by your number of meals for protein per meal, and plan your eating accordingly.</p>
        <p>Use our <a href="/">protein intake calculator</a> for instant results, or follow the formulas above to calculate manually. Either way, knowing your protein target is the first step to optimizing your nutrition for your goals.</p>
