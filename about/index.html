      <p class="intro-text">Protein Intake Calculator is a free tool that helps you determine how much protein you need daily based on your body weight, activity level, and fitness goals. Whether you're building muscle, losing weight, or simply trying to eat healthier, our calculator provides personalized recommendations grounded in nutritional science.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>What This Calculator Does</h2>
      <p>Our calculator offers four specialized tools, each designed for a specific purpose:</p>

      <h3>Daily Protein Calculator</h3>
      <p>The primary calculator determines your baseline protein needs based on your body weight, activity level, and general goal (maintain health, build muscle, or lose weight). It provides a recommended range with minimum, optimal, and maximum values, giving you flexibility in how you meet your protein target.</p>

      <h3>Muscle Building Calculator</h3>
      <p>Designed specifically for those focused on gaining muscle mass, this calculator factors in your training intensity and experience level. It also offers the option to calculate based on lean body mass (LBM) rather than total body weight, which provides more accurate recommendations for individuals with higher body fat percentages.</p>

      <h3>Weight Loss Calculator</h3>
      <p>When you're in a calorie deficit, your protein needs actually increase to help preserve muscle mass. This calculator accounts for your current weight, goal weight, and how aggressive your deficit is. Larger deficits require higher protein intake to prevent muscle loss during weight loss.</p>

      <h3>Per Meal Calculator</h3>
      <p>Once you know your daily protein target, this tool helps you distribute it across your meals. Research suggests that spreading protein intake evenly throughout the day may optimize muscle protein synthesis, and this calculator shows you exactly how much protein to aim for at each meal.</p>

      <h2>The Science Behind Our Recommendations</h2>
      <p>Protein requirements vary significantly based on activity level, goals, and individual factors. Our calculator uses evidence-based ranges that reflect the current scientific consensus on protein intake:</p>

      <h3>Activity-Based Protein Needs</h3>
      <p><strong>Sedentary individuals</strong> require approximately 0.36-0.5 grams of protein per pound of body weight. This aligns with the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), which represents the minimum needed to prevent deficiency in most healthy adults.</p>

      <p><strong>Moderately active individuals</strong> benefit from 0.5-0.8 grams per pound. Regular physical activity increases protein turnover and creates a greater demand for amino acids to support recovery and adaptation.</p>

      <p><strong>Athletes and those doing intense resistance training</strong> typically need 0.7-1.0 grams per pound. The scientific literature consistently shows that this range optimizes muscle protein synthesis for most people engaged in regular strength training.</p>

      <h3>Why Needs Vary</h3>
      <p>Your body uses protein for far more than just building muscle. Protein provides the amino acids necessary for enzyme production, immune function, hormone synthesis, and tissue repair. When you exercise, you create microscopic damage to muscle fibers that requires additional protein for repair and growth. When you're in a calorie deficit, your body may break down muscle for energy unless adequate protein is available.</p>

      <p>The multipliers we use (grams per pound of body weight) scale recommendations appropriately for different body sizes while accounting for activity-induced increases in protein turnover.</p>

      <div class="callout-box callout-box--info">
        <h4>Research Foundation</h4>
        <p>Our recommendations align with position stands from the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN), the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), and meta-analyses published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. The 0.7-1.0g/lb range for muscle building is supported by Schoenfeld & Aragon's 2018 meta-analysis of 49 studies.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Who This Calculator Is For</h2>
      <p>Our calculator serves a wide range of users with different goals:</p>

      <p><strong>Strength athletes and bodybuilders</strong> use the muscle building calculator to ensure they're consuming enough protein to support hypertrophy. The option to calculate based on lean body mass is particularly useful for this group.</p>

      <p><strong>People losing weight</strong> often underestimate how much protein they need during a diet. Our weight loss calculator helps ensure you preserve hard-earned muscle while shedding fat.</p>

      <p><strong>Endurance athletes</strong> (runners, cyclists, swimmers) have elevated protein needs due to increased muscle breakdown during prolonged exercise. The moderate-to-active settings account for these demands.</p>

      <p><strong>Older adults</strong> may benefit from higher protein intakes to combat age-related muscle loss (sarcopenia). Research suggests that protein needs may increase with age, making adequate intake even more important.</p>

      <p><strong>General health-conscious individuals</strong> can use the daily calculator to ensure they're meeting basic protein requirements for overall health and wellbeing.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Our Methodology</h2>
      <p>The recommendations provided by this calculator are based on the broad scientific consensus established through decades of nutrition research. We've synthesized findings from sports nutrition literature, dietary guidelines, and metabolic studies to create practical ranges that work for most people.</p>

      <p>Our approach prioritizes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Conservative minimums:</strong> The lower end of each range represents the amount most experts agree is sufficient for the stated goal.</li>
        <li><strong>Practical maximums:</strong> The upper end reflects the point beyond which additional protein provides diminishing returns for most people.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> By providing ranges rather than single numbers, we acknowledge that individual responses to protein intake vary.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We regularly review our formulas against current research and update them as the scientific understanding of protein metabolism evolves.</p>

      <p><em>The RDA represents the minimum to prevent deficiency, not the optimal amount for active individuals. Our ranges align closely with ISSN and ACSM recommendations.</em></p>

      <h2>How to Use the Calculator</h2>

      <h3>Step 1: Choose Your Calculator Tab</h3>
      <p>Select the tab that matches your primary goal. If you're unsure, start with the Daily Protein calculator for a general recommendation.</p>

      <h3>Step 2: Enter Your Information</h3>
      <p>Input your body weight and select your activity level or training intensity. Be honest about your activity level; overestimating leads to unnecessarily high protein targets.</p>

      <h3>Step 3: Review Your Results</h3>
      <p>The calculator displays your recommended protein intake as a range. The "optimal" value represents the sweet spot for most people, but anywhere within the range is appropriate.</p>

      <h3>Step 4: Plan Your Meals</h3>
      <p>Use the Per Meal calculator to divide your daily target across your meals. This helps you plan balanced meals that contribute meaningfully to your protein goal.</p>

      <h3>Step 5: Track and Adjust</h3>
      <p>Monitor your progress over several weeks. If you're not seeing expected results, consider adjusting within your recommended range or reassessing your activity level inputs.</p>
